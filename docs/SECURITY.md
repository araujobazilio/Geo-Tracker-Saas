# Security

## Status

Phase 0/1 establish foundational security primitives. Full authentication,
session handling, tenant-access enforcement, and CSRF are added in
Phase 2. Security hardening is Phase 17.

## Implemented

- **Password hashing:** Argon2id via `argon2-cffi` (`app/core/security.py`).
- **Opaque server-side sessions:** session tokens are cryptographically
  secure random values; session data stored in Redis under SHA-256 hash
  of the token. See `docs/AUTHENTICATION.md`.
- **Cookie security:** HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure (enforced in
  staging/production), Path=/, explicit Max-Age.
- **CSRF protection:** server-side CSRF token stored in session; validated
  via `X-CSRF-Token` header on POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE. Constant-time
  comparison.
- **Session fixation protection:** new token issued on every login.
- **Login timing mitigation:** dummy Argon2id verification for nonexistent
  users.
- **Password rehash:** outdated Argon2id parameters detected and upgraded
  on successful login.
- **Rate limiting:** Redis-backed throttling for login and register
  endpoints.
- **Email normalization:** canonical lowercase storage prevents
  casing-based duplicate accounts.
- **Secrets:** loaded from environment via `pydantic-settings`; `.env` is
  git-ignored; only `.env.example` is committed.
- **Production secret validation:** `APP_SECRET_KEY` is validated at config
  load time. In staging/production, empty, known-placeholder, or
  too-short (< 32 chars) secrets are rejected with a clear error. The
  real secret value is never included in error messages.
  See `app/config.py` (`Settings._validate_production_secret`).
- **Constant-time comparison:** `safe_eq` helper for sensitive comparisons.
- **Tenant isolation enforcement:** `WorkspaceAuthorizationService` checks
  database membership for every workspace-scoped operation. Non-members
  receive 404 (not 403) to avoid revealing resource existence.
  See `docs/MULTITENANCY.md`.
- **UUIDs:** public-facing identifiers are UUIDs to reduce IDOR risk.
- **Database accounting integrity:** `usage_events` has database-level
  non-negative CHECK constraints for `ai_checks`, token counts, and
  `cost_usd` (see `docs/DATABASE.md`).
- **AppSumo license uniqueness:** `external_license_id` is UNIQUE at the
  database level.
- **Audit logging:** centralized `AuditService` records auth and workspace
  events. Never stores session tokens, CSRF tokens, passwords, or hashes.
- **Logging:** structured logs never include passwords, API keys, or tokens.
- **Error handling:** application errors never expose stack traces to
  clients (see `app/core/exceptions.py`).

## Planned (later phases)

- Rate limiting (Phase 17).
- Webhook signature verification + replay protection (Phase 14/15).
- Encrypted secret storage for future BYOK (Phase 17+).
- Output escaping in templates (Phase 12).

## Rules

- Never store authentication credentials or bearer tokens in `localStorage`.
- Never expose server API keys to frontend JavaScript.
- Never commit `.env`, credentials, private keys, or access tokens.
- Never log secrets, credentials, or authentication tokens.
- Never store passwords, API secrets, or auth tokens in audit logs.
